This app uses distribution functions from base R and the Flexsurv package. Details
for each distribution are provided below

#### Exponential Distribution
The base R exponential function has density,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\phi}&= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \exp(\hat{\epsilon}),
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Weibull Distribution

#### Gamma Distribution

#### Lognormal Distribution

#### Gompertz Distribution

#### Log-logistic Distribution

#### Generalized Gamma Distribution
